# About Portable-VirtualBox

Portable-VirtualBox is a free and open source software tool that lets you run any operating system from a USB stick without separate installation.

Initially the tool was developed and maintained by Runar Buvik. Check out his site at http://www.vbox.me/.

This repository is a fork for trying to keep the tool running as good as I can.

# Motivation

# Building

Simply clone this project and convert the code with `Aut2exe_x64.exe` or `Aut2exe.exe`. You can choose any other icon, if you want. 

# Running

At first start the generated executable.
